# For Hacktoberfest Contributors
1. This is a dummy version of a research project with a lot more going on than shown in the repo
2. I am hoping to create an end-to-end SAAS so that my team's research can be used in real life
3. For this I need a front-end that looks good and is usable 
4. Also would like to have it dockerized for ease of deployement
